/// <see cref="BlockFlowState.Match{TResult}"/>: every one of the seven cases supplies an arm, so
/// a case with no legal transitions (<c>closed</c>) has to say so explicitly (an empty list)

/// only says which edges exist and where each one lands. <c>recertification-refused</c> (§8 block
/// C, <c>approved → briefed</c>) is not yet in this table — it lands in the block that ships it.
